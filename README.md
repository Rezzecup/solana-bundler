# Solana Bundler Overview

The Solana Bundler is an innovative open-source script crafted to ease the complexity of conducting buying and selling operations using 27 wallets simultaneously on the Solana blockchain. This exceptional tool is aimed at users who require seamless management of multiple transactions, ensuring efficiency and efficacy.

## Initial Setup

To utilize the Solana Raydium Bundler efficiently, please adhere to the following setup and execution guidelines.

### Step 1: Configuration

- **Edit the `.env` File:** Before executing the script, configuring the `.env` file is essential. You will need two keypairs:

  - **SOL Distribution Fees Keypair:** This keypair handles the payment of all SOL distribution fees.
  - **Pool Creation Keypair:** This keypair facilitates pool creation. For security, ensure these keypairs are distinct.

  While testing the script, you can employ the same keypair for both purposes. Always store these keypairs securely.

### Step 2: Execution of Functions

**Note:** To maintain error-free execution, it is vital to perform these steps sequentially. 

- **Create Keypairs (Step 1):** Even though not mandatory for every launch, it is advisable to create new keypairs initially or during resets to assure no SOL remains in the wallets.

- **Premarket (Step 2):** This multi-step process must follow a specific sequence:

  1. **Execution Sequence:** Complete steps 2 through 6 sequentially.
  2. **Bundle ID Validation:** After each step, confirm the Bundle ID to ensure successful landing.
  3. **Repeat if Necessary:** If landing fails, elevate the tip and attempt again. Exit if required.
  4. **Cross-Verification:** Utilize the Jito Block Explorer to verify bundle landing. Disregard the "Landed - no" indication; ensure the first transaction is confirmed.

- **Create Pool (Step 3):** Pool creation may warrant multiple attempts:

  - Use function spamming if initial attempts fail to land the pool creation.
  - Enhance the tip, with 0.1 SOL or higher recommended for improved landing chances.

- **Selling Options (Steps 4 and 5):**

  1. **Simultaneous Keypair Sale (Step 4):** Consolidate the sale of all keypairs and reclaim WSOL in Premarket's Step 7 post-rugging.
  2. **Percentage-Based Selling (Step 5):** Execute sales of varying percentages upon request by transferring specific portions of each keypair's token balance to the fee payers before executing a singular bundle sale.

- **Liquidity Pool Removal (Step 6):** The process for removing LP is direct:
  - **Non-Burn Removal:** Without LP burning, it will automatically be removed.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- **Bundle Success:** Adapt the tip or retry the operation if the bundle doesn't land. Jito Block Explorer serves as a verification tool.
- **Keypair Security:** Ensure keypairs are secure and correctly entered in the `.env` file.
- **Prudent Function Spamming:** Monitor transactions vigilantly to prevent unnecessary SOL expenditure during spam attempts.
